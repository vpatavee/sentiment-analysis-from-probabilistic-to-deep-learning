    "# Classical Machine Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "In this first Notebook, we will discuss classical but powerful machine learning model that are widely used for text classification.\n",
    "\n",
    "The first question is, how to featurize the text. We can use words, subwords characters or even bytes to represent the our dataset (IMDB review). For English text classification, we usually use words or subwords as features. These features capture the linguistic features more than bytes or characters. In this first three Notebook, we will use words as features, and will discuss subwords in later Notebook. Note that this is not the only ways we featurize text. For other problem like language detection, we can use character n-grams as features (think of it!). In this Notebook, we will first discuss and experiment several tokenization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The second question is how to vectorize i.e. how to represent features into vector space. The simplest way is one-hot encoding, which is a vector of size equal to number of words words in consideration where all element is zero but the element corresponding to the word being represented. In section 2 of this Notebook, we will discuss and experiment several vectorization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "The last question is which model. In this experiment, we will use [logistic regression](https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/5.pdf) and [Naive Bayes]( https://web.stanford.edu/~jurafsky/slp3/4.pdf), which are commonly used for text classification. \n",

    "- Remove stopwords: In our problem, we can think that words like `is`, `of` do not carry any linguistic features that are useful for text classification. We will remove them from the text so that it will not introduce noise to the model. Moreover, these words are likely to appear in almost every document so they provide very less information for the model to classify the document. However, removing stop is not necessary useful. We can also say that a good model should be able to learn this by itself. We will see if this is useful or not.\n",
    "\n",
    "- lower and lemma\n",
    "The intuition of lowercase and lematization is that it can group words with similar meaning but in different form together. For example, `It is a good movie.` and `It is the best movie.` If we tokenize and lemmatize these two sentneces, the results will share the token `good`. If we tokenize but not lemmatize, `good` and `best` will be different tokens. Lemmatization may or may not improve the accuracy of models. It depends on what kind of NLP tasks we are wokring on. Let's do the experiment and see how lemmatization effects the accuracy of our models and discuss why.\n",

On the other hand, logistic regression is discriminative model which predict targets directly `P(Y|X)`. The parameters of the model are estimated with numerical methods i.e. gradient descent.\n",
