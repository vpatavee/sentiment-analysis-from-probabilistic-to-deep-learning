    "# More On Word Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "As we found at the end of the Notebook 2, we only use only 80% of information in average and discard the rest. In this experiment, we will explore how can we use information from the dataset more efficiently i.e. reduce the fraction of discard information. Although we still focus on word embeddings, we will tackle it differently this time. \n",
    "\n",
    "First let's recall from the Notebook 2 the reason why the efficiency is not very high. In that experiment, we vectorize  text by getting word embeddings corresponding to each tokens from pre-trained word embeddings and then polling to one single vector representing the text. For tokens that we don't have corresponding word embeddings, we randomly pick one from the pre-trained word embeddings (or we can simply ignore). Because there are some tokens, approximately 20%, that do not present in our pre-trained word embeddings, it means that we discard those tokens and so the model will never learn from this information.\n",
    "\n",
    "One way to solve this problem is to train word embeddings using the train set (we can't use both train and test to train word embeddings due to data leakage). This way we will every token in train set a corresponding vector. We may still observe unknown tokens in test set, but it will be much less than what we observed in Notebook 2.\n",
    "\n",
    "This [paper](https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/Q15-1016.pdf) discusses various aspects of word embeddings on different tasks, as well as hyper parameters tuning. However, they didn't benchmark on text classification task as our experiment.\n",

    "## Window Size\n",
    "\n",
    "Generally speaking, window size is a size of context of consideration. For example, sentence `... We can address this issue by introducing ...  `, let's focus at word `this`. If the context size = 2, the model will try to encode the meaning of word `this` by considering some words in `can`, `address`, `issue`, `by`. It will not take `we` into account because it is out of considered context. For more details, see the [original paper](https://papers.nips.cc/paper/5021-distributed-representations-of-words-and-phrases-and-their-compositionality.pdf). The intuition behind is this is that training the model with smaller size of windows will give you embeddings that encode more syntactic meaning. It will learn that words like `is`, `was` are similar because it's replaceable within a small window. The larger window size tends to create embeddings that can encode broader idea or topic or words. See [this paper](https://levyomer.files.wordpress.com/2014/04/dependency-based-word-embeddings-acl-2014.pdf) for more details. Whichever better is better depends on the downstream task. For example, one can say that smaller window size can perform better for downstream task like analogy, while larger size can be better for text classification. We will do experiment and see if it is the case.\n",

    "Epochs is a little tricker than window size. In general, the more epochs can lead to overfitting. However, does overfitting present in Word2Vec, or does concept of overfitting make sense at all for Word2Vec? (Don't mess up with text classification model, which absolutely can be overfit). Let's go back to the fundamental concept of overiftting - overfitting occurs when a function (model) is too closely fit to a train set and are unable to generalize to other data points e.g. data points in test set. In Word2Vec (as well as other language models), we use text corpus for both training samples and thier labels. For Word2Vec, the training samples are the center words and labels are context word, (for SG, opposite for C-BOW. For traditional language model, training data can be words 0th to nth and labels can be n+1th word. Cutting-edge language models like BERT and GPT-2 use slightly different apporaches, but the fundamental idea is the same. So, can language model overfit? Can language model predict a word given some other words very well but perform poorly on data points that it hasn't been trained on? Yes, of course. Let's narrow down the question: what happen to embeddings if the Word2Vec model is overfit? Will it undermine the classification model? We will experiment on that. See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1803.05651.pdf#:~:text=Standard%20Word2Vec%20may%20be%20prone,a%20regu%2D%20larizer%20against%20it.&text=Word%20vectors%20are%20continuous%20representations,most%20deep%20learning%20NLP%20models.) for more info.\n",

But, generally speaking, we can say that higher dimension means higher capacity of vessel. For how much information it is in the vessel depends on how we fill it in the vessel (training process for Word2Vec, or counting process for one hot encoding, etc). If the dataset is smaller, we may need smaller dimension because we don't have that much information to encode in. Most literatures suggest dimension of size 300 is good in most case.

    "\n",
    "By training our word embeddings from train data, we should be aware that our word embeddings may be less quality , i.e. capture less semantic, than those pre-trained word embeddings used in Notebook 2. While those vectors are trained on several billion tokens, our word embeddings will be trained on much less dataset. We can say that our embeddings will capture the meaning of tokens more specific to domain i.e. movie reviews. But we can also say that embeddings corresponding to more common tokens will capture less semantic than those from pre-trained Word2Vec.\n",
    "\n",
    "We can address this issue by introducing transfer learning. In high level, it's general term used when you train a model with one dataset (generally larger), then you (partially or entirely) use parameters of this trained model to train another model on another dataset (generally smaller). That new dataset and new model can be slightly different from the original model i.e. the different prediction targets or so. The use cases can be like when we train image classification from one domains and then \"transfer\" knowledge to another domain. We can apply similar technique by \"transfer\" pre-trained Word2Vec knowledge to our model. For formal definition and examples, see [this](https://towardsdatascience.com/a-comprehensive-hands-on-guide-to-transfer-learning-with-real-world-applications-in-deep-learning-212bf3b2f27a).\n",

    "The obvious approach is to start training the Word2Vec model with parameters from pre-trained Word2Vec, instead of small randomized parameters. Then, the second question is what are vocabularies? We can combine vocabularies from our training set with pre-trained vocabularies. However, pre-trained vocabularies size are much larger (3M vs 100k), as we discussed in Notebook 0. If we augmented 100k vocabularies with 3M and train the Word2Vec model, the effect of 100k will be very slightly. In fact, this is not necessary matter if we just want to learn embeddings for those 100 vocabularies from training set, let alone the number embeddings transfered from Word2Vec. In the experiment, we will see the effect of the size of augmented vocabularies.\n",

    "We can also choose whether to freeze the embeddings transfered from pre-trained Word2Vec. If we freeze, only embeddings that are not transfered, i.e. embeddings corresponding to vocab that are in the train data but not pre-trained Word2Vec, will be trained. We will experiment both options.\n",

Although the [documentation](https://radimrehurek.com/gensim/models/word2vec.html) suggests that it inherits the parameters from pretrained Word2Vec, I am not sure that what happen internally what consequences during training. (You can see I put several assert in the function to make sure that the API works as planned). Moreover, this API is a bit experimental and not many examples can be found."
